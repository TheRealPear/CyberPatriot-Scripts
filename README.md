# CyberPatriot Scripts
Used for the ***REMOVED*** CyberPatriot team, 2019-2020.

## Windows
This comes with two seperate Batch file. `CyberPatriot.bat` includes an interactive menu and several controls. `simplified.bat` is meant to be lightweight, easy to write down on paper, includes crucial commands, and no menu as it's automatc. Be sure to use both files as `CyberPatriot.bat` relies on `simplified.bat` for semi-automation (or it will not work!).

## Linux
Bash script coming soon.
