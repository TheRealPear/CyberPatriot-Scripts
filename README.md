# CyberPatriot Scripts
Semi-automatic security hardening script for Windows.
Used for my high school CyberPatriot team in the 2019-2021 academic years while COVID-19 happened.

## Windows
This comes with two seperate Batch file. `CyberPatriot.bat` includes an interactive menu and several controls. `simplified.bat` is meant to be lightweight, easy to write down on paper, includes crucial commands, and no menu as it's automatc. 

Be sure to use both files as `CyberPatriot.bat` relies on `simplified.bat` for semi-automation (or it will not work!).

## Linux
Bash script coming soon.
